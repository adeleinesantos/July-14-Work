<h1>Wizard of Oz</h1>
<p>"What must I do?" asked the girl.</p>
<p>"Kill the Wicked Witch of the West," answered Oz.</p>
<p>"But I cannot!" exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.</p>
<p>"You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which bear a powerful charm.  There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all this land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to Kansas--but not before."</p>
<p>The little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz felt that she could help him if she would.</p>
